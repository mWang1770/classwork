# Corey Schafer's Python Tutorial for Beginners

Corey Schafer has an excellent [python tutorial for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7). Watch each video and take notes in this file.

As you watch the video, have a code editor open and type out what Corey types. Run the code and modify the code. Do this even if you don't *yet* understand what is happening.

The videos are on average 20 minutes long. Commit to watching one video after school for the first two weeks. **This tutorial is meant to serve as an introduction and to show you what is possible in a programming language**. Understanding and mastery come from daily practice.

## 1: Install and Setup for Mac and Windows
    - start and search for cmd (command prompt)
    - type python--version
        - will probably shiw that it can not find file, 
        - if so, go on the website and download most recent version 
        - check the PATH box to avoid work
        - after it finishes downloading, you can double check by doing the cmd thing again
    - # message 
        - same as commenting
        - does not affect code 
    - print('message') or print("message")
        - prints out message
    - editors that can be used: 
        -Atom.io, SuboimeText.com, Pycharm(IDE)
